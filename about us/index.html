            <p class="row">The poet is describing the various wild animals. These animals are very dangerous and she has introduced them one by one in a very funny way. First of all she tells us about an Asian lion. She says that if you are visiting the jungles of the east and there you see an animal which has tawny skin and he roars so loudly that you will die out of fear. This means that you have seen an Asian lion. Next in the line is the Bengal tiger that she has explained to be a royal animal that at once attacks and kills a man. She says by adding humour that if this beautiful black striped animal kills you and eats you, then you have surely met a Bengal tiger. After this, she says that if the reader met an animal that has black spotted skin and it at once jumps on him, then it means that the reader has met a leopard. Moreover, she says that if one will cry out in pain, it maybe of no use as the leopard will not stop attacking him. Then she moves on to the bear that she says will hug very tightly. This is the way to recognize a bear as it kills a person by hugging him very tightly. So, she says that the bear will continue to hug us tightly and that is the only way to recognize him. After this, she asks a question to the readers that do they know how to recognize beasts that hunt their prey. </p>

        <div class="ene">The poet suggests some dangerous ways of identifying wild animals. The suggested ways create humour. He says if you ever visit 
            the jungles in the east and you happen to encounter a lion, a tiger or a leopard, you’ll be able to identify them by the way they attack upon you.The idea of ‘Identifying while dying’ makes you laugh. He also tells you to identify a bear from its friendly, hard bear-hug, a hyena from its laugh and a crocodile from its weeping while swallowing its victim. If you see nothing on the tree, then there is a chameleon as it has the  quality to change its colour according to its surroundings.The poem revolves around the dangerous ways to identify wild animals. The poet tries to distinguish one animal from the other in a humorous way. The poem is, thus, very educative and informative which tells us about various features of wild animals.The poet here says if by chance you happen to go to any forest in the east, you are likely to encounter a huge and terrible animalmoving towards you. The poet says that it is very likely that while roaming in the forest, you are greeted by a wild beast.

        <div class="shi">The poet says that while you are walking in your yard, you may encounter a creature there. When this creature hugs you very very tightly, then believe that it is a Bear. The poet further says that in case of any doubt, you will find that the Bear will embrace you once again till death.The poet, here, helps to differentiate the Crocodile from the Hyena. He says that a Hyena always laughs as it swallows its victim. A laughing Hyena’s voice resembles human’s laughing sound. A crocodile on the other hand, is said to shed tears while eating its prey.The poet describes a chameleon in this stanza. He says a chameleon is a small garden lizard. It doesn’t have ears or wings. The poet, further, says if you are unable to see a thing on the tree, then chances are that a chameleon is sitting there.The poet here helps the readers to identify a Leopard. He says if you happen to walk in the forest, you might encounter a beast with spots on his skin. When this wild beast will jump at you, you will understand that it is a Leopard as he will keep jumping on you and will tear you apart. Moreover, it will be of no use then to shout or cry with pain because he will continue pouncing on you. So you should be careful.
